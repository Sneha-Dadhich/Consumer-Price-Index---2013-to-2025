Title: Consumer Price Index (CPI) Data Analysis - 2013 to 2025

Description:
The project is an interactive web app for analyzing CPI trends, inflation rates, and price changes over time. Built with Streamlit, Pandas, and Matplotlib, it features visualizations of sector-wise, state-wise, and monthly CPI data. Users can compare inflation trends across regions and categories, gaining insights into economic patterns. 



This Streamlit-based project visualizes and analyzes Consumer Price Index (CPI) data from 2013 to 2025, focusing on inflation trends across states, sectors, and categories. The approach includes:

1. Data Preprocessing
- Loads CPI data (cpi Group data.csv).
- Handles missing values (* replaced with NaN).
- Converts necessary columns (Inflation (%), Index) to numeric.
- Fills missing values with the median in 'Inflation (%)' and 'Index' Column.
- Converts categorical columns (BaseYear, Year) to strings.

2. Streamlit UI Components
- Tabs for Navigation: Four sectionsâ€”Introduction, Static Data, Data Insights, and Comparison.
- Introduction Tab: Displays dataset structure and key attributes.
- Static Data Tab: Provides year-wise breakdown:
   -- Year-wise category & sector distribution (Pie Charts).
   -- Inflation trend analysis (Line Charts).
- Data Insights Tab: Allows interactive exploration:
Year-wise inflation trends per state (Bar Chart).
   -- Month-wise inflation trends (Line Chart).
   -- State-wise inflation analysis.
- Comparison Tab: Multi-state comparison of inflation trends over time.

3. Key Visualizations
- Pie Charts: Breakdown of category and sector ratios.
- Line Charts: Inflation trends over years for states, sectors, and categories.
- Bar Charts: State-wise inflation trends.
- Interactive Filters: Users can select specific years, states, and categories for analysis.

Conclusion
This project is a data-driven dashboard for analyzing inflation trends based on CPI data, enabling interactive exploration of trends across years, states, and consumption categories.
